### 3 - Extract dates ----


# Define the dates that the data are extracted from and to
# Dates are in ddmmyyyy format


# The beginning of baseline period/extract window
start_date        <- lubridate::dmy(01012018)

# The beginning of baseline period/extract window for trend data
start_date_trends <- lubridate::dmy(01012016)

# The end of the baseline period (for model)
base_end          <- lubridate::dmy(31122020)

# Five years earlier for the five year look-back (pmorbs5)
start_date_5      <- lubridate::dmy(01012013)

# First day of latest quarter in current publication
qtr_start         <- lubridate::dmy(01102020)

# End date for the cut off for data
end_date          <- lubridate::dmy(31122020)

# Publication date
pub_day <- pub_date(end_date = end_date, pub = "current")

## 4 - Create data folder structure ----
#  If the folder doesn't exist creates it and subfolders too
if (dir.exists(paste0(data_folder, pub_day)) == FALSE) {
  dir.create(paste0(data_folder, pub_day))

  dir.create(paste0(data_folder, pub_day, "/tde"))
  dir.create(paste0(data_folder, pub_day, "/output"))
}

## 5 - Load common lookups to all scripts ----
# Hospital names
hospitals <- bind_rows(read_spss(paste0(
  plat_filepath,
  "lookups/Unicode/National Reference Files/",
  "location.sav")) %>%
    select(Location, Locname) %>%
    rename(location      = Location,
           location_name = Locname),
  read_spss(paste0(plat_filepath,
                   "lookups/Unicode/National Reference Files/",
                   "Health_Board_Identifiers.sav")) %>%
    select(description, HB_Area_2014) %>%
    rename(location      = HB_Area_2014,
           location_name = description),
  tibble(location = "Scot", location_name = "Scotland"),
  tibble(location = "S08000029", location_name = "NHS Fife"),
  tibble(location = "S08000030", location_name = "NHS Tayside"),
