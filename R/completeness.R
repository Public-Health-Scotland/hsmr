#' @title SMR01 completeness
#'
#' @description \code{completeness} takes the first day of the latest quarter
#' of data which are included in the current HSMR publication. It extracts
#' completeness information for the SMR01 dataset from the
#' \href{https://www.isdscotland.org/Products-and-Services/Data-Support-and-Monitoring/SMR-Completeness/_docs/SMR_Estimates.xlsx}{SMR Completeness Estimates spreadsheet}
#' published on the
#' \href{https://www.isdscotland.org/}{ISD website}. It extracts the
#' completeness percentages for the two most recent quarters for all health
#' boards and Scotland.
#'
#' @details The \code{completeness} function assumes that the list of health
#' board names (including Scotland) is contained in cells B31:B47 in the
#' spreadsheet, where B29 is `NHS Board` and B47 is `All NHS Boards`. Should
#' this change, \code{completeness} should be edited accordingly.
#'
#' The URL of the spreadsheet is occasionally modified. Should this happen,
#' \code{completeness} should again be edited accordingly.
#'
#' If the ISD website is down, \code{completeness} will return an error saying
#' it has timed out. The \code{hsmr} package will also fail to build when the
#' website is down, and the unit tests relating to \code{completeness} will
#' fail, as access to the spreadsheet is required. Nothing can be done in this
#' instance other than waiting for the website to return to normal.
#'
#' @param quarter A \code{character} string specifying the quarter for which
#' completeness data should be returned. Valid options are `previous` and
#' `current`.
#' @param level A \code{character} string specifying the geographic level for
#' which completeness data should be returned. Valid options are `board` and
#' `scotland`.
#' @param first_day The first day of the latest quarter, supplied with
#' \code{Date} class. Must be the first day of either January, April, July or
#' October. Only one value of \code{first_day} is valid at any one time. When
#' the spreadsheet is updated with a new quarter's data, the previously valid
#' value of \code{first_day} will now return an error, and a new value (the
#' previous value + 3 months) should be supplied instead.
#'
#' @return When \code{level} is set equal to \code{board}, \code{completeness}
#' returns a sentence listing the boards (if any) which had an SMR01
#' completeness level of less than 95 percent for the specified \code{quarter}.
#' When \code{level} is set equal to \code{scotland}, \code{completeness}
#' returns Scotland's SMR01 completeness level for the specified \code{quarter}
#' as a percentage.
